### NEW! Signed URLs

<br/>

If you are using an alternative storage solution (e.g. Google, Rackspace, etc), Blitline supports the use of signed_urls. Many of these services, offer the ability to sign a url for uploading, which can then be used by Blitline for uploading your final images to them.

<br/> 

The benefit of this is that you do not need to give Blitline any permissions to your services. The signed url contains all the information necessary. 

<br/>

**Important** : You must be able to generate a *signed_url* on your own. We (Blitline) cannot generate it for you. Most modern SDKs for the various services allow for creation of these signed_urls

<br/>

To use these signed urls with Blitline, the *signed_url* sits within an *signed_destination* like this:

<br/>

{% highlight json %}

{
	  "signed_destination" : {
	    "signed_url" : "https://storage.googleapis.com/blitline-test/foo.jpg?GoogleAccessId=431349666209-pbehjivpm9f0rqf2cdujasamur469p15@developer.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=1314370741&Signature=oPLJFBWQG9mLa7Uo%2BfQ...HuFvFaOpH7NmCT5XDHEw%3D%3D",
	    "headers" : {
	      "Content-Type" : "image.jpg"
	    }
	}
}

{% endhighlight %}

Remember: If you signed a url with headers, you must include those same headers in the *signed_destination*

### Google Example:

<br/>

Google provides numerous SDK's and a command line utility for signing URLs. The command line tool is the easiest to test and demonstrate with. The command line tool is named **gsutil** You can find the official documentation here: 

https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil

<br/>

This particular command line tool has the ability to sign urls for uploading. You can read more about gsutil signing here: 

https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/signurl

<br/>

To sign a file for uploading, first determine what the bucket and key are going to be for your file. For example, with a bucket name of **blitline-test** and a key of *foo.jpg*, the gsutil command would look like this:

<br/>

```
gsutil signurl -p notasecret -c image/jpg -m PUT -d 1h ~/.mykeys/mygoogleauthkey.p12 gs://blitline-test/foo.jpg
```

<br/>

Notice that we've specified the content type (image/jpg) and are using the **PUT** verb (as opposed to the POST verb which will not work for Blitline).

<br/>

The output URL can then be used in the Blitline JSON via the **signed_destination** node. As we can see in the example above, we would just replace the **signed_url** with the URL generated by the gsutil. 

<br/>

{% highlight json %}

{
	  "signed_destination" : {
	    "signed_url" : "https://storage.googleapis.com/blitline-test/foo.jpg?GoogleAccessId=431349666209-pbehjivpm9f0rqf2cdujasamur469p15@developer.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=1314370741&Signature=oPLJFBWQG9mLa7Uo%2BfQ...HuFvFaOpH7NmCT5XDHEw%3D%3D",
	    "headers" : {
	      "Content-Type" : "image.jpg"
	    }
	}
}

{% endhighlight %}
