#### Setting your AWS Canonical ID

It is VERY important that you set your AWS Canonical ID on your Blitline.com account. You can set the Canonical ID by logging in to Blitline.com, and locating it on the logged in homepage.

Without the Canonical ID, we cannot make YOU the owner of the image. Even though it is in **your** bucket, Blitline will still be the owner of the object and you will not be able to do anything to it (such as rename, or re-permission) and your only option will be to **copy** it somewhere, thus making you the owner of the copy. SO, make sure you set the Canonical ID!

####How do I get my AWS Canonical ID?

First, make sure you are logged in to the AWS web console. Then navigate to https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential 

On this screen you will click the 
**Account Identifiers** section.

Copy and paste this into the Blitline.com homepage Canonical ID section, and click the **Update** button.
