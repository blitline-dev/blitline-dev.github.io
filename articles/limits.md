### Blitline Service Limits

<br/>

While we strive to serve all image processing needs, we need to set certain limits to make sure a small subset of users affect the larger subset. We have limits in place to prevent overloading our infrastructure and protect the integrity of the Blitline service at all times.

<br/>

Here are some limits we impose:

<br/>

- Files to process must be smaller than **800M**
- Submitted Job JSON is limited to **250k characters**
- Only burst_pdf supports PDFs with more than **20 pages**
- Burst PDF functionality is limited to **1500 pages**
- During postback, your server must respond within **15 seconds**

<br/>

Here are recommendations we offer:

<br/>

- If you are doing more than **1,000,000 jobs/hour** for an extended period of time, you should contact us at support@blitline.com to make sure we do not rate limit your app.
